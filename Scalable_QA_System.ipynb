He has the classical Baratheon look: black hair and bright blue eyes, and is a very tall man, with Eddard Stark estimating him to be six and a half feet.

Sketches would be in black and white with the aim of identifying the correct style, tone of voice, scale and detail, for approval by HBO and Tourism Ireland. Once approved, the line drawings would pass through the colourisation phase. The colourisation phase is a lengthy process of converting the monochrome designs into a coloured piece of illustrated artwork.

The title sequence serves as a guide to the physical landscape of the world of ''Game of Thrones'', and details of the title sequence change each week depending on the locations visited, and new locations may be added in each season.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '1eda7e619e4122ce8ece54663206274e', 'range': (0, 152)}, {'doc_id': '2f2487ca34b95d6660bb731a1d147e03', 'range': (894, 1128)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3d6dee7567c7e62be320cd7b7fd303ae'}>,\n",

For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow\\'s flight from King\\'s Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show.

There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.

He is a childhood friend of Catelyn Stark, having grown up with her and her two siblings at Riverrun.

He is set to appear in the forthcoming novel ''The Winds of Winter''. Littlefinger's primary character attributes are his cunning and boundless ambition. Originally hailing from a minor family with little wealth or influence, Baelish used manipulation, bribery, and the connections he secured at Riverrun to gain power and prestige in King's Landing. Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '9e2951b89eb7599b597e546d1973968e', 'range': (929, 1237)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

Going into filming, one of McLachlan\\'s most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\"White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil.

The cities of Slaver\\'s Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages. Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, \"If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin.\"Peterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between classical Latin and the Romance languages, or more accurately between Classical Arabic and the modern varieties of Arabic, in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 16, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'd1dc67cd8dd5b3cf0d87714586b159b4', 'range': (0, 107)}, {'doc_id': 'abe9b3ff2233faa5c1d5c182f5fc9d36', 'range': (853, 1199)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5178fa8ccd6dcf01195eff10561ca1c4'}>,\n",

It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\\n\\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, b, d, g have become v, ð, ɣ; subsequently, p, t, k have become b, d, g in the same environment.\\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\'  in High Valyrian, but as \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\'  in Astapori.

Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\"). There is also an indefinite article, \\'\\'me\\'\\' , derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'mēre\\'\\'  (\"one\"). Word stress is less predictable than in High Valyrian, but commands are stressed word-finally (for example: \\'\\'ivetrá\\'\\').\\n\\n=== Meereenese Valyrian ===\\n\\nMeereenese Valyrian appears in Seasons 4 and 6 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.

It aired on April 13, 2014.\\n\\nThe episode focuses principally on the long-awaited royal wedding between Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, which ends tragically as Joffrey dies after drinking poisoned wine at the reception, a plot development that despite being in the books came as a shock to viewers since it abruptly killed the show\\'s principal villain just a few episodes after the Red Wedding had violently killed off several of the show\\'s protagonists. Other storylines include House Bolton\\'s quest to retake the North, and Bran\\'s continued journey north of The Wall. The title refers to the sigils of the wedding couple\\'s respective houses – a lion for Joffrey Baratheon, who is in truth an illegitimate bastard, and a rose for Margaery Tyrell.\\n\\nOff-camera, \"The Lion and the Rose\" is notable as the last episode Martin wrote for the series.

Unlike his previous three episodes, his draft of the screenplay has some major differences from the episode as produced, with more minor characters and detail at the wedding feast. Most significantly, it sets up some plotlines from the books that the series would ultimately not use, such as Ramsay marrying an impostor woman posing as Arya instead of Sansa.

We used that as our model\". Benioff said, \"The \\'Battle of the Bastards\\' becomes incredibly compact. All these men, all these combatants, crammed into this incredibly tight space on the battlefield.

This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn\\'t one that both made you feel what it was like to be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle.\"According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, \"Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there\\'s arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck.
